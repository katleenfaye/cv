            <h3><em><strong>Front-end Developer</strong></em></h3>
            <p>I am a dedicated, hardworking and proactive individual with a
            strong background in production planning, monitoring, technical
            and hardware skills. My previous work has developed my
            communication skills and teamwork as I collaborate across
            departments to ensure customer satisfaction. As I encounter
            different and uncertain situations, I am able to think out of the box
            when challenges or problems arise and staying calm and focus on
            my goal is more efficient. I am currently looking for an opportunity
            to utilize my skills in a challenging working environment and
            become a valuable asset to the organization that I work for.</p>
